    "The selected code is a comment block that outlines the purpose and structure of the electricity billing calculation. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `#Generating Electricity Bills` - This comment indicates that the following code is intended to calculate electricity bills based on the number of units consumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The subsequent lines describe the billing structure:\n",
    "   - `# 1 to 100 units - 1.5Rs` - For the first 100 units, the cost is 1.5 Rs per unit.\n",
    "   - `# 101 to 200 units - 2.5Rs` - For units between 101 and 200, the cost is 2.5 Rs per unit.\n",
    "   - `# 201 to 300 units - 4Rs` - For units between 201 and 300, the cost is 4 Rs per unit.\n",
    "   - `# 300 to 350 units - 5Rs` - For units between 301 and 350, the cost is 5 Rs per unit.\n",
    "   - `# Above 350 - Fixed charge 1500Rs` - For any consumption above 350 units, a fixed charge of 1500 Rs is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `#Concepts to Learn` - This comment suggests that the following code will demonstrate certain programming concepts, likely related to function definition and conditional statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this selected code provides a clear overview of the billing structure and the educational intent behind the code that follows."
